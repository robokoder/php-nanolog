# Nanolog

Small and simple logging solution for PHP >= 5.3

## Install

    composer install Nanolog\Nanolog

## Usage

### One log instance in DEBUG mode (default)

    $log = \Nanolog\Nanolog::create('/tmp');

    $log->critical('Cant connect to server');
    $log->error('Cant open file');
    $log->warning('Disk is 90% full');
    $log->info('User foobar logged in');
    $log->debug(print_r($obj, true));

    $log = null;
    $log = \Nanolog\Nanolog::getInstance();
    $log->info('We have our log instance back again');

### Multiple log instances by name

    $log1 = \Nanolog\Nanolog::create('/tmp', \Nanolog\Nanolog::DEBUG, 'log_one');
    $log2 = \Nanolog\Nanolog::create('/var/log', \Nanolog\Nanolog::DEBUG, 'log_two');

    $log1->info('Our log_one instance was created');
    $log2->info('Our log_two instance was created');

    $log1 = null; // oops

    $log1 = \Nanolog\Nanolog::getInstance('log_one');
    $log1->info('We have our log_one back!');
